# UI Components Showcase

A web app built with React, TypeScript, SCSS, GSAP, and Vite, demonstrating a variety of reusable UI components, including bar, donut, and column charts, a to-do list, a wizard, and some others I've built for various projects.

It also includes additional features such as toast notifications implemented with React-Tostify and a splash screen, providing a comprehensive view of modern UI elements abilities in action.

Use this command to run the project locally:
`npm run dev`
